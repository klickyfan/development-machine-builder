The three scripts in this repo, Step1GetPowerShell7.ps1, Step2.ps1, and
Step3InstallVSExtensions.ps1, when run sequentially, set up a Windows 10
laptop as recommended by Seal Pod (for Seal Pod project development).

There are some things these scripts do not do that you may want to do
yourself:

* update Microsoft Edge
* sign in to your preferred browser(s)
* sign in to OneDrive
* sign in to Getihub Desktop
